#cat adoption website
This is a website for adopting cats. It shows some cats that are up for adoption and states their names and a little fact about them. I also added an "About Us" page where there is a paragraph about the company. This website was done with flexbox. It was first done in HTML and CSS only. Later on, I converted it into React and I also used Vite while converting it. Then I used Netlify to deploy my website.
